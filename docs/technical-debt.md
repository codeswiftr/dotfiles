# üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt & Refactoring Guide

This document tracks known technical debt, legacy code/configs, and refactor opportunities in the dotfiles project. Contributors are encouraged to help address these items!

If you find outdated guides, legacy configs, or documentation debt, please open an issue or PR and add them here. See [README.md](../README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more ways to help!

## üö® Legacy Scripts & Configs

- **Legacy install logic:**
  - scripts/bootstrap.sh and install.sh contain legacy code paths for older platforms and tools.
  - Migration plan: Refactor to use only modern toolchain (mise, uv, bun, etc.), remove deprecated logic.

- **Neovim config paths:**
  - Some legacy configs in config/nvim/lua/core/ and docs/legacy-backup-20250714/.
  - Migration plan: Consolidate to streamlined init-streamlined.lua and modular Lua configs.

- **Tmux mouse mode:**
  - Enabled by default; some users prefer it off for pure keyboard workflows.
  - Migration plan: Make mouse mode opt-in, document in README and troubleshooting.

## üìù Documentation Debt

- Some guides (legacy-backup-20250714/*) are outdated or duplicated.
- Migration plan: Archive legacy docs, update cross-links, and ensure all new docs are discoverable from docs/README.md.

### Deletion candidates (post-merge)
- `docs/legacy-backup-20250714/**` ‚Äî content superseded by consolidated docs. Action: fold any remaining unique details into current guides, then remove folder.
- `src/--help/` ‚Äî empty placeholder. Action: populate with CLI examples or remove.
- Generated artifacts: `tests/results/**`, `.pytest_cache/**`. Action: exclude from index, add cleanup script (e.g., `scripts/cleanup-artifacts.sh`).

#### New candidates
- `docs/shell-performance-guide.md` ‚Äî content duplicated in `docs/performance.md`. Action: merge any remaining unique tips, then delete.

### Consolidation tasks
- Merge `docs/shell-performance-guide.md` into `docs/performance.md` (single comprehensive performance guide).
- Fold `docs/nvim-quick-reference.md` into `docs/neovim.md` as a Quick Reference section.
- Review `docs/navigation.md` versus Neovim/tmux quick refs to remove duplication and cross-link.

## ‚ö° Toolchain Consistency

- Some templates/scripts may use older tools (pyenv, nvm, etc.) instead of mise, uv, bun.
- Migration plan: Audit all templates/scripts and update to use only the intended modern toolchain.

## üß™ Testing & Linting Coverage

- Not all scripts/configs are covered by tests or linting.
- Migration plan: Expand test_runner.sh, add shellcheck/yamllint to CI, and document how contributors can run these locally.

## ü§ñ Agentic Workflow Automation

- Gemini CLI review is recommended before every commit, but not enforced.
- Migration plan: Document agentic workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md and encourage referencing Gemini review in PRs.

## üîß Configuration and UX Debt (New)

### Tmux keybinding conflicts
- Analysis files (`config/tmux/tmux-analysis.md`, `config/tmux/tmux-dx-plan.md`) identify critical overrides (e.g., `Ctrl-a c/d`).
- Action: Restore defaults for `c` (new-window) and `d` (detach), move AI/dev shortcuts under capital letters (A/D/T/G/M), keep Tier 1 ‚â§ 10 bindings.

### Neovim tier enforcement
- Ensure Tier 1 stays <200ms; reduce plugin count and verify `config/nvim/lua/tiers/*` reflect intended sets.
- Action: Audit actual plugin set vs docs; align and document in `docs/neovim.md`.

### Installer docs drift
- `INSTALL-DECLARATIVE.md` now references `./install.sh`. Keep in sync with script flags and profiles.
- Action: Add a short ‚Äúsync checklist‚Äù in PR template for installer changes.
