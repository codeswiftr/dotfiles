# DEPRECATED VIM CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# 
# This .vimrc file has been DEPRECATED and replaced with modern Neovim Lua configuration.
# 
# NEW CONFIGURATION LOCATION: ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
# 
# WHY THIS CHANGE:
# 1. Neovim's Lua configuration is faster and more modern
# 2. Better plugin ecosystem with lazy.nvim
# 3. Native LSP support for better development experience
# 4. Catppuccin theme with AI plugin integration
# 5. Performance improvements and cleaner code organization
# 
# TO COMPLETE THE MIGRATION:
# 1. Remove or rename this .vimrc file
# 2. Ensure ~/.config/nvim/init.lua is properly configured
# 3. Use 'nvim' command instead of 'vim' for editing
# 
# IF YOU NEED VIM (not Neovim):
# - This file contains your old vim configuration
# - Rename .vimrc.deprecated back to .vimrc
# - But we recommend using Neovim for the modern experience
